# Add a Bidder Adapter to Prebid Server
{:.no_toc}

This page describes how to write the code for a bidder adapter that integrates with [Prebid Server]({{site.baseurl}}/dev-docs/get-started-with-prebid-server.html).

## Step 0. Gather helpful info

When writing your adapter it may be useful to refer to:

- Existing bidder adapters
- API documentation

To read the source code of the existing adapters, see [the prebid-server repo](https://github.com/prebid/prebid-server/tree/master/adapters).

For autogenerated API documentation using [`godoc`](http://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc), run the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/prebid/prebid-server
$ cd prebid-server/
$ godoc ./adapters/
```

## Step 1. Understand the high level API

Now that you have the source code and perhaps the `godoc` output (or have just read `adapter.go`), you can see that the adapter interface you need to implement is:

- `Name`: Returns the code name of the adapter, a string -- must match the bidder code in Prebid.js
- `FamilyName`: Returns a string used to build the OpenRTB bid request; used for cookie management
- `GetUsersyncInfo`: Returns user sync info for this bidder.  For more information about user syncing, see [What is Cookie Syncing and How Does it Work?](http://clearcode.cc/2015/12/cookie-syncing/)
- `SkipNoCookies`: Returns a boolean value that answers: Should this adapter be called if there is no user ID on the impression?
- `Call`: Takes the request from the client and produces a bid request that is then sent to the adapter's external server.

Note that your adapter must be in the `adapters` package.

## Step 2. Build Prebid Server, run the tests

See the instructions in the repo 

As of this writing, when you `go test`, you end up testing everything in the project. To test just the adapter code, run:

`$ go test ./adapters/`

If everything goes as planned, you should see something like:

`ok  	github.com/prebid/prebid-server/adapters	0.098s`

A failing test will look something like the following (which was the result of changing the bidder code to an invalid value):

```
--- FAIL: TestAppNexusBasicResponse (0.01s)
	appnexus_test.go:326: ParsePBSRequest returned invalid bidder
body {"account_id":"","tid":"","cache_markup":0,"sort_bids":0,"max_key_length":0,"secure":0,"timeout_millis":0,"ad_units":[{"code":"first-tag","is_top_frame":0,"sizes":[{"w":300,"h":250}],"bids":[{"bidder":"audienceNetwork","bid_id":"random-id-from-pbjs-0","params":{"placementId":"987654321_999998888"}}],"config_id":""},{"code":"second-tag","is_top_frame":0,"sizes":[{"w":300,"h":250}],"bids":[{"bidder":"audienceNetwork","bid_id":"random-id-from-pbjs-1","params":{"placementId":"987654321_66775544"}}],"config_id":""}],"is_debug":false,"app":null,"device":null,"Start":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
```

## Step 3. Maybe write a failing test?
